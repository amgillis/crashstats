#### By Avi Gillis

This is a case study on the Victorian Crash stats database. The case study includes some rudimentary EDA as well as a few attempts at creating a predictive model.

- EDA work is in notebooks/crashstats_eda.ipynb
- Modeling work is in notebooks/crashstats_model.ipynb
- All data can be found in data directory
- Models can be loaded from .joblib files in model dir
- All figs from EDA are saved in figs dir

Thanks!
